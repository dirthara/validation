# Project instructions

## Ownership
Dirthara owns this package. Attribute copyright, licensing, and authorship to `Dirthara` rather than to an individual 
maintainer. The MIT `LICENSE` reads `Copyright (c) <year> Dirthara`, and new files or documents that name an owner
use the same name.

## Branching
Every supported version has its own branch; there is no `main`. Target a feature at the newest release branch and a fix 
at the earliest supported branch that has the bug, then forward-merge upward. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before 
branching, merging, or releasing.

## Committing
Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, or anything else that writes to history or to the remote. Stage nothing 
and commit nothing: the maintainer commits and pushes every change themselves. Leave the work in the working tree
and say what is ready.

## Tests
Line coverage of `src` must stay at 100%; `composer coverage` fails below it and lists the uncovered lines. Add tests 
in `tests` with every implementation change. The empty scaffold explicitly skips tests and coverage until PHP files 
exist in `src` or `tests`; after that, the full checks are required.

## Development
Use the PHP container for Composer and PHP commands; see [README.md](README.md). This package has no database services or 
database dependencies.
Use the `Dirthara\Validation` namespace for source and `Dirthara\Validation\Tests` for tests. Declare strict 
types in every PHP file.

## Exceptions
Read and follow https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/blob/main/docs/coding-standards/cs-7-exceptions-error-handling.md when creating or modifying exceptions.

## Documentation
Read and follow https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/blob/main/docs/coding-standards/cs-6-documentation.md when writing the README or anything in `docs`.

## Packaging
Read and follow https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/blob/main/docs/coding-standards/cs-8-packaging.md when 
changing what a release contains, the actions the CI workflow uses, or the dependency update configuration.

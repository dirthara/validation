## Branching

There is no `main`. Every supported version has its own long-lived branch, named
for its major and minor version:

```text
0.1   ← the first release line
0.2   ← the next minor, branched from 0.1
1.0   ← the next major, branched from 0.2
```

The newest release branch is the repository's default branch. A release branch
lives as long as the version it carries is supported, and is deleted only when
that version reaches end of life.

Patch versions do not get a branch. They are tags on the release branch they
belong to, so `0.1.3` is a tag on `0.1`.

### Where work goes

Work happens on a short-lived branch and arrives through a pull request. Name it
after what it does:

| Branch | For |
| --- | --- |
| `feature/<issue>-short-slug` | A new feature. |
| `bugfix/<issue>-short-slug` | A fix for a reported bug. |
| `hotfix/<short-slug>` | An urgent fix that ships as a patch release immediately. |

What you target depends on what you are doing:

- **A feature** targets the newest release branch. Features never go into an
  older line, because that line is already released.
- **A fix** targets the *earliest supported branch that has the bug*, not the
  newest. A bug present since `0.1` is fixed on `0.1`.

Branch off the branch you intend to target, so the pull request contains your
commits and nothing else.

### Forward merging

A fix that lands on an older branch has to reach every newer one. After the pull
request merges, merge the release branches upward in ascending order:

```sh
git switch 0.1
git pull

git switch 0.2
git merge 0.1
git push

git switch 1.0
git merge 0.2
git push
```

Merge, rather than cherry-pick. A merge records that the fix reached each
branch, so the next forward merge does not offer it again and the same conflict
is never resolved twice.

:warning: Never merge a newer branch into an older one. That drags unreleased
work into a released line, which is how a patch release ends up containing a
feature.

Expect conflicts in `composer.json` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` when the
branches support different PHP versions, or dependency constraints differ. Resolve them in favour of the branch you are merging
into — the newer branch keeps its own constraints and its own matrix.

### PHP versions are per branch

Each release branch declares the PHP versions it supports in two places, and
they have to agree:

- the `php` constraint in `composer.json`
- the `php` matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which CI passes to the image
  as the `PHP_VERSION` build argument

Because the workflow lives on the branch, every branch tests exactly the
versions it claims to support. Dropping a PHP version in `1.0` does not change
what `0.1` tests.

## Releases

A release is a tag on a release branch:

```sh
git switch 0.1
git tag 0.1.3
git push origin 0.1.3
```

A release is gated on a perfect [Plumb](https://plumbphp.dev) score. Every
package scores 100 before it is tagged; the packaging rules that get it there
are in [agents/packaging.md](agents/packaging.md).

```sh
curl -X POST https://plumbphp.dev/api/v1/packages/dirthara/validation
```

Score the repository first and fix what it reports, because the checks split by
what they read. The workflow pins, the updater configuration, and the security
policy read the repository and change as soon as a commit is pushed. The
lockfile and the lean archive read the released archive, so they cannot pass
before a tag exists. A first release therefore scores the repository to 100,
tags, and rescores to confirm the archive.

Opening a new minor or major means branching from the newest release branch,
pointing the repository's default branch at it, and applying branch protection
to it:

```sh
git switch -c 0.2 0.1
git push -u origin 0.2
```

Then update the supported versions table below and in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md); both must list the same branches.

## Supported versions

| Branch | PHP | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1` | 8.5 | Active |

The initial `0.1` scaffold is unreleased.

## Before you open a pull request

Run everything CI runs:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer ci
```

That is Mago's formatter, linter, analyzer, and architecture rules, then the
test suite with coverage, then the coverage gate. Start the PHP container with `docker compose up -d php`. CI uses the same
image. The individual commands are in [README.md](README.md).

Your pull request needs:

- **Every check green.** A single `CI` check reports the result of Mago and of
  the test suite on every supported PHP version.
- **Full coverage of `src`.** The gate fails the build below 100% line coverage
  and prints the uncovered lines. Cover new code with tests in the pull request that adds it.

- **Documentation that matches.** Behaviour that the [docs](docs) describe is
  updated in the same pull request. See the conventions in
  [agents/documentation.md](agents/documentation.md).

## Maintainers: protecting a release branch

Branch protection is per branch, so a new release branch starts unprotected.
Apply it as soon as the branch exists:

```sh
scripts/protect-branch.sh 0.2
```

The script requires the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) with admin rights on
the repository. It requires the `CI` check to pass and be up to date with the
branch before a pull request can merge, and blocks force pushes and deletion.

`CI` is the only required check on purpose. It is a job that succeeds only when
Mago and every matrix entry succeeded, so adding a PHP version to the matrix
never means editing branch protection.
